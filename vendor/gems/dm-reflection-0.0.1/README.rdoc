= dm-reflection

For now, this gem only allows you to print the ruby source for any DataMapper::Model, taking all property and relationship definitions into account. However, the plan is to be able to reflect on an existing relational database schema and export the corresponding datamapper model definitions to ruby source files. Think of it as active_record and annotate_models combined to do something useful with legacy databases.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'dm-core'
  require 'dm-reflection'

  class Project

    include DataMapper::Resource

    property :id, Serial

    property :name, String, :required => true, :length => 200
    property :created_at, DateTime
    property :updated_at, DateTime

    has 0..n, :project_tasks
    has 0..n, :tasks, :through => :project_tasks
    has 0..n, :people, :through => Resource

  end

  Project.to_ruby # produces this nicely formatted ruby code

  <<-RUBY
  class Project

    include DataMapper::Resource

    property :id, Serial

    property :name, String, :required => true, :length => 200
    property :created_at, DateTime
    property :updated_at, DateTime

    has 0..n, :project_tasks
    has 0..n, :tasks, :through => :project_tasks
    has 0..n, :people, :through => Resource

  end
  RUBY

Also, you can create models from a repository by doing the following:

  require 'dm-reflection'
  models = DataMapper::Reflection.reflect(:default)
  
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
